What is YARL?

YARL is yet another roguelike - a role playing game with a randomly
generated and highly dynamic world.

Being in its early development stage, YARL does not have all its
features implemented yet. Therefore the current stage of the project
does not represent the final product.


How to compile

YARL can be compiled using cmake 3.2 or later:

$ cmake . && make

Due to cmake 3 being relatively new, many distributions do not yet offer
it in their repositories. On such systems YARL can be compiled with the
following command:

$ g++ --std=c++11 `pkg-config --libs --cflags ncurses` -o yarl src/*.cpp
